# Land-Cover-ML

### This project identifies the land cover of a satellite image based on the given Indian-Pines Training Dataset.

Three approaches were used :-
  1. Using Only CNN as ML-model
  2. Using Only SVM as ML-model
  3. Using a hybrid model of CNN-SVM

The main Objective of this project is to compare the accuracy in the results obtained in all of these three models. 

The result show that Hybrid model predicts results with better accuracy.
